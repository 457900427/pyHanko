This repository contains some experimental Python code related to incrementally updating, 
stamping & signing PDF files.

 - Invisible signatures (both certifying and non-certifying) should work.
 - Visible signatures are still a bit primitive.
 - Through fontTools, we have (experimental) support for auto-subsetting and embedding CFF fonts (more testing needed).
 - Support for handling encrypted files has been added in, but is untested.
 - The signer supports PKCS11 devices too (see beid.py for an example).


Some TODOs
----------

 - The signing/stamping code currently only works on PDF files with a flat page tree (which fortunately covers the vast majority of real-life examples). For the signer, this is relatively easy to work around, but the resource dictionary handling logic in the stamper needs to be reworked a little to cover the general case.
 - Add validation functionality.
 - Add a proper CLI.
 - Add systematic tests, both with real-world PDF files and minimal examples from the spec.

This repository includes some code from PyPDF2 (with modifications); see pdf_utils/LICENSE.PyPDF2.
