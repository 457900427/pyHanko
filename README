This repository contains some experimental Python code related to incrementally updating, 
stamping & signing PDF files.

 - Invisible signatures (both certifying and non-certifying) should work.
 - Adding and signing signature fields is experimental, especially with regards to the appearance
   of the signature (for now, it's nothing more than a gray box).
 - Support for handling encrypted files has been added in, but is untested.


Some TODOs
----------

 - Improve handling of signature field widgets.
 - Rework the stamper to also operate in append mode, to minimise potential mangling caused 
   by rerendering the entire file through PyPDF2. This would also allow me to remove the dependency
   on PyFPDF.
 - Add validation functionality.
 - Add systematic tests, both with real-world PDF files and minimal examples from the spec.

This repository includes some code from PyPDF2 (with modifications); see pdf_utils/LICENSE.PyPDF2.
