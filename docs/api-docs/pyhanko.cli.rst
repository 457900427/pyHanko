pyhanko.cli module
==================

.. warning::
    This is the reference page for the (as of now largely undocumented)
    ``pyhanko.cli`` module that backs pyHanko's command-line interface.
    You probably don't want/need to call this module's functions from your own
    python code.

    Chances are that you were looking for
    the :ref:`CLI user guide <cli-user-guide>`
    or the :ref:`library user guide <lib-user-guide>` instead.
